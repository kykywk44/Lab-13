                    <p class="desc">A photo shoot can be conducted in a studio or on location. The photography process usually begins with a consultation between the photographer and the subject to discuss the goals of the shoot and the desired look and mood of the images. On the day of the shoot, the photographer sets up equipment and lighting in the desired location. Once the shoot is complete, the photographer selects the best shots and edits them, achieving the desired look and mood. The finished images are handed over to the customer or the subject.

                    <h3>Videography</h3>
                    <p class="desc">The video filming process typically begins with a consultation between the videographer and the client to discuss the goals of the video and the desired look and feel of the footage. Once the consultation is complete, the videographer will develop a shot list, which is a list of the specific shots that they want to capture.

                    <h3>Montage</h3>
                    <p class="desc">After the shoot is complete, the videographer will edit the footage to create the final video. This may involve trimming the footage, adding music and sound effects, and creating transitions between shots. The final video will then be delivered to the client.
